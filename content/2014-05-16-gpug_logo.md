> Logo - Man this brings back memories. I remember my first interaction with a computer when I was about 12 years old. I did math lessons on what I think was a [Commodore Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) . I looked around and found Logo installed somewhere on it. I figured it out and convinced our school in [George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George,_Western_Cape) to buy 2 computers. I then became the Outeniqua Pre-Primary Schools first computer teacher. I coded a clock using Logo and it was running on one of the computers for about three months. People from all over came to have a look. Schools then started buying computers. They couldn't be seen to fall behind our small school you know! This was 1987/1988 - about 25 years ago! ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Amiga500_system.jpg/309px-Amiga500_system.jpg)# Logo Programming LanguageThe [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_programming_language) programming language was as graphical environment to teach and learn programming. You were the master of a [Turtle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) and told it what to do. Move forward, turn left. The turtle has a pen on its belly and it draws a line wherever it goes. The picture below shows some of the steps you can do to make a rectangle![](http://www.thesmartbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/logo_mit-300x184.png)		# Gauteng Python Users GroupWe recently started the [Gautent Python Users Group]() and we joked about creating a Pythonic logo. I remembered that the Python standard distribution comes installed with a Turtle graphics / Logo module. Here is the code and the result.# The GPUG generated Logo
Here is a small movie of the output of the script. See the poor turtle moving.

# Run the code
You can download the code above, or just run the command below te get it working. If this doens't work, just download the file at [Here](http://bit.ly/gpug_logo). Save it and run it using Python.
