<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
This post will focus on using the new widget and interact functionality of IPython 2 to generate Excel like interactive pivot tables. (Well almost you will get the idea)

One idea is to write a plugin that you can call on a file or dataframe with a magic command, and then an interactive Excel Like Pivot Table is produced.
