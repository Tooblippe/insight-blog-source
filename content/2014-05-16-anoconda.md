> **Packages** - When it comes to doing scientific work it can become difficult to install some of the packages like matplotlib, IPython and sci-kit learn as you need to have the compilation environment set up properly. [Anaconda](http://www.insightstack.co.za/insightstack-software/) solves this by making it possible to download a full python stack for any platform. It includes more than [125 Python Packages](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkgs.html).> **Environments** - When it comes to managing your packages and environments it also bundles a package manager. Enter Conda, the only package and environment control system I think I will need. Create environments. Update packages. No problem. And yes PIP and easy_install also still work.I will take you through a presentation by Travis Oliphant from [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io/) detailing Anaconda and Conda.
